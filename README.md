# Simple Result Display

## Overview
This web application is a basic demonstration that displays the number 600 within a designated HTML element, styled using Bootstrap for a clean and responsive presentation. It serves as a simple test project to verify the functionality of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration.

## Features
*   Displays the number 600 in the `#result` element.
*   Utilizes Bootstrap for basic styling and responsiveness.
*   Simple and easy to understand codebase.

## Usage
1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  The number 600 will be displayed within the `#result` element, styled with Bootstrap classes.
3.  Inspect the element in your browser's developer tools to verify the styling.

## Technical Details
